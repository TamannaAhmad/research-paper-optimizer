# Research Paper Optimizer

With the Research Paper Optimizer, our aim was to provide support to develop a research paper. Researchers may face challenges in publishing due to not adhering to the expected industry standards. Our objective is to decrease the challenges faced by the researchers (new or experienced) by providing multiple tools for different aspects of the papers, as listed below:
### Features:
- Quality Assurance Checks: Provide users with a report of the determined quality of their input paper by:
  - Coherence and relevance checks
  - Plagiarism detection
  - Citation Validation
- Generative Models: 
  - Generate an abstract
  - Generate captions for images
 
### Using the App:
Deployed as a Streamlit Web Application, this project can be easily accessed via [this link](https://research-paper-optimizer.streamlit.app/). 
First, upload your draft research paper in PDF form via the 'Browse Files' button in the side panel. Once the paper has been uploaded and processed, you can use any of the tools via the tabs present along the top.
1. Abstract Generator:
Get a recommended abstract generated that is tailored to the content of your research paper.
2. Image Caption Generator:
This tool detects and extracts images from your paper and generates suitable captions.
3. Citation Validator:
Use the Citation Validator to make sure that your paper's citations adhere to the proper formatting guidelines and are properly referenced within the body of the paper.
4. Quality Assurance:
This tool can let you know if there are any logical inconsistencies in your paper's content. Good quality writing is essential for publications, and this tool helps with that.
5. Relevance Checker:
While referring to existing papers, it can become tedious to go through several papers to determine whether they are relevant to your topic. This tool helps you to quickly determine whether a paper can be used, lessening the amount of time spent on irrelevant papers.
Refer to the demonstration video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10ADBUAfJQ9MH-tGHNOiHiqYKVlnluI0o/view?usp=drive_link) to check how the tool works.
